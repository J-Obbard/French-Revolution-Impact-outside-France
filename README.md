Introduction
The French Revolution would drastically impact the late 18th and the 19th Century in both the political and social aspects. Through social movements, political upheaval, and war. The world would see historical empires fall with new empires, nation states, or previously established monarchies come to rule. The revolution would enable individuals to become part of the political process who had not been before and give confidence to those who yearned to become independent from slavery or monarchy.

French Social Order
The population of France witnessed a seismic change in the way they viewed the state and their fellow citizens, from changes in types of leadership to the creation of a national identity. Certain members of the population, males of certain criteria, would be able to engage in political discussion and have an influence in deciding policy for the first time in their lives.  
The involvement in politics would create a broad sense of belonging to the state and its functions, defining a role for people working for the benefit of the state and its citizens. Everybody who was eligible could use their skills as individuals or part of a project to help improve the nation for all. 

Although women were excluded from the political arena, they were a key part of the nation state. The nationalist agenda believed that women’s roles were more domestic , emphasising the important role of motherhood as contributing to the nation. With calls for women to produce many children and to raise them in the hope they would take the nation forward.
Literature and the social messages of the period contained texts looking toward a common future of freedom and equality, it was the unifying message of a nation. Revolutionaries believed the laws of man affected all citizens, who were free and equal to the state. The French people experienced a fundamental transformation in self-identity.
Romanticism was a key feature of literature of the revolution, with French nationalists rediscovering the 11th Century poem Song of Roland.  A poem about a French military leader and his soldiers ambushed by Muslim forces at Roncesvalles, all the French soldiers would give their lives to protect the forces ahead of them.  This tale of French bravery and sacrifice would resonate with the revolutionaries in the late 18th Century and alongside other works of art and literature inspire the people of France.

French Political Order
The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen introduced by France’s National Constituent Assembly on the 27th of August 1789   provided the basis for a nation of free individuals protected by law. It defined collective and individual rights for all men and displayed the values of individual liberty and democracy which had greatly influenced the attitude of the French Revolution.
Article 2 of the declaration sets out that the role of the Government was to grant and protect the natural rights available to all men, rights of accessibility to property, life and liberty.  

While the Declaration spoke of ‘men being free and equal in rights’ determining who would enjoy the benefits of this proclamation would exclude many men and all women of the nation. To be able to benefit from this declaration a man had to be first a man but also deemed an ‘active citizen’.

The Declaration of the Rights of Men and of the Citizen was challenged by Olympe de Gouges, a playwright who challenged male authority and the inequality posed in the Declaration in her 1791 Declaration of the Rights of Women of the Female Citizen . de Gouges in her declaration countered the many articles in the 1789 Declaration which excluded women and added articles such as Articles X through XII which would push for women’s issues to be included and seen as important.
Olympe de Gouges was executed in November of 1793 for seditious behaviour and attacking the Revolutionary Government. 

The National Convention was established after armed revolutionaries stormed the Tuileries Palace on 10th of August 1792. The first session of the convention was held on the 20th of September 1792, on the 21st the convention passed a motion abolishing the monarchy and establishing France as a Republic.

The convention would last for three turbulent years with different political factions taking a lead, The Girondins and the Montagnards. This period would see the rise of Maximilien Robespierre, a statesman who would champion the cause universal male suffrage but also be implicated in the Reign of Terror . The Terror was a period which was meant to discourage support for the enemies of revolution but resulted in more executions being carried out for those willing to speak out.

The French Republic would remain until 1799 when a coup d’état by the leader of the French Army, Napoleon Bonaparte. Napoleon would secure an election enabling him to be First Consul of the Republic. 
Napoleon faced many assassination plots from royalist opponents, he used these threats as justification for him to expand his power, Napoleon won heavily a referendum giving him powers to change his role from First Consul to Emperor of the French.
Napoleon would lead the French through a period in which France and its armies dominated Europe, conquering foreign armies on the borders and introducing the Napoleonic Code , a civic code that would influence many countries that France had annexed.

Foreign Political Impact
The impact and message of the Revolution helped shape many liberal national governments in Europe, although Napoleon had placed people friendly to the French ideals in charge of these countries.  
Napoleon forced his brother Louis on to the throne of the Dutch Kingdom . This would allow Napoleon to use the Dutch army to fight for his cause, but his brother would not enable a national conscription to fight against the British forces. Napoleon annexed the Kingdom into the French Empire after forcing his brother to abdicate the throne in 1810. 
The Dutch Kingdom would remain under French control until the fall of Napoleon in 1815, it would become the United Kingdom of the Netherlands under the rule of King William I. 

With the French Empire wielding great strength in numbers on its march through Europe, nations would need to rally as many troops as possible to fight the inevitable march against them by the French. 
The power of the French army had caused the Holy Roman Emperor Francis II to found the Austrian Empire. This empire would encompass the states and cities that made up the Holy Roman Empire, which would be dissolved in 1806. The Austrian Empire would lose key battles to the French at Ulm and Austerlitz in 1805, these defeats would force Francis into negotiations for an armistice, which took effect on the 6th of December 1805.

With France’s position as the strongest force on the European Mainland solidified, many of the rulers of territories within the Austrian Empire would break free and align themselves with the French. The King of Bavaria Maximilian I Joseph, the King of Wurttemberg Frederick III and the Grand Duke of Baden all became allies to France.

Foreign Social Impact
The revolution had a great effect on the peoples of Europe and Latin America. The social classes would either embrace the messages of equality and liberty to change the lives of the people in their own countries, or people would see the brutal handling of the French royals and opponents and try to fight to prevent a similar situation happening with their own borders. 
In Germany, the revolution initially brought liberal and democratic ideas to the countries intellectuals, who saw what was happening in France as the triumph of the Enlightenment. 
The beheading of Louis XVI was opposed by the royal courts of Berlin and Vienna, fearing the spread of the revolutionaries message of ‘liberty’. The behaviour towards the French monarchy would disillusion the German middle classes. 
German intellectuals like Johann Gottlieb Fichte determined that the nation did not identify with the state but rather with the Volk, the people. Poet Ernst Moritz Arndt claimed that if a state needed to defend the values of the German nation then it would be a unified German nation, not Prussia, Austria or Bavaria. 

France’s strength allowed them to control neighbouring countries like Belgium and Switzerland. Belgium was under French control between the years 1794 and 1814, France would impose legal reforms and draft the Belgian male population into his armies, these men were heavily taxed whilst fighting. 
The Belgian population were resistant to French rule but saw benefits from the ruling country. The port city of Antwerp was able to grow rapidly as a business and commercial centre , due to the increased access to markets, the middle-class entrepreneurs flourished.

The French colony of Saint-Domingue in Latin America saw a revolt against the ruling powers by the areas slave population in 1791. With the French Republic declaring all men free and equal, citizens in Saint-Domingue saw it as an opportunity to further their own ideals and positions. The plantation owners saw an opportunity to gain independence from the French state to increase their wealth and power while the slave population would seek independence from the chains of slavery.
The slave population began on the night of the 21st of August 1791, the slaves began to execute the masters in revenge for the treatment they had received whilst on the plantations.  By the 31st of August 1791, the rebelling slaves had taken control of the Northern Province, with the former slave owners only keeping control of a few fortified camps. 
The success of the rebellion caused the French Assembly to grant civil and political rights to free men of colour in the colonies in March of 1792, slavery would be abolished  in the Northern Province soon after.

Conclusion 
The changes seen from the 1789 revolution in France had an enormous effect on the political lives of millions of people in states and nations around the European continent and Latin America. 

With ruler Napoleon Bonaparte changing the political landscape of Europe within a few years through his conquests, which brought historical empires down. Trevor Getz writes “although he suppressed many of the liberties established by the French Revolution in France, Bonaparte’s armies did help spread the revolutionary ideas of social and political freedoms”. 

The influence of France in these countries helps shape future opinion as Geoffrey Ellis states “Germany’s and Italy’s experience of French rule, the vision of a greater political union and the lessons of a more professional bureaucratic structures influenced nationalist and liberal ideologies alike.” 

The extent of which the oppressed peoples were inspired by the revolution is shown through national identities and literature, Eric Hobsbawm writes France gave the world a model for revolutions and ideas “to the point where a tricolour became the emblem of virtually every emerging nation”.
